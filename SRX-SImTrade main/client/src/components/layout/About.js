      <p>
        Welcome to mysticalmanav! I'm Manav, a sophomore at IIT Dhanbad, where I'm pursuing a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
        My journey in the world of technology and web development began with a spark of curiosity and a passion for creating meaningful digital experiences.

        As a full-stack web developer, I thrive on turning ideas into reality. My love for coding has led me to work on more than 3 professional projects, each pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web.
        From crafting intricate front-end interfaces to architecting robust back-end systems, I'm dedicated to delivering solutions that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

        While my academic pursuits provide a strong foundation, it's my practical experience that truly fuels my growth. I'm committed to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices, ensuring that my work is always on the cutting edge.
        With a deep appreciation for problem-solving and attention to detail, I believe in making every line of code count.
